🚀 I’m excited to share my new personal project – **Interactive Registration Form**, a **frontend web form** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that validates user input in real time.

🔗 **Live Demo**: *(Add your GitHub Pages link here)*

🎯 **Project Highlights**:

* A clean, centered **registration form UI** styled with CSS for a professional look, including a card-style table layout with shadows and rounded corners.
* **Form fields** for Name, Email, and Password, each equipped with validation rules.
* **JavaScript input validation** using regex:

  * Name accepts only letters.
  * Email must follow Gmail format.
  * Password requires at least 6 valid characters.
* **Error messages** displayed dynamically under invalid inputs in red.
* Successful validation triggers a **confirmation alert** (“✅ Form Submitted Successfully”).
* Designed to be user-friendly with inline hints and instant feedback.

💡 **What I Learned**:

* Using **regex (regular expressions)** for input validation.
* Handling **form submission events** in JavaScript with `event.preventDefault()`.
* Displaying and hiding error messages dynamically with DOM manipulation.
* Structuring and styling forms for usability and accessibility.

📌 **Next Steps**:

* Add more fields like confirm password, phone number, and dropdowns.
* Improve password validation with stronger rules (uppercase, numbers, symbols).
* Store user data in **localStorage** or connect to a backend.
* Enhance design using **Tailwind CSS** or Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness.

This project helped me practice building **functional forms with client-side validation**, which is a fundamental skill in web development.
